## Here's how you can turn this into a Django app:

Create a new Django app by running the following command in your terminal:

You need to have DJango installed

```py - m pip install django```


python manage.py startapp trivia
or py -m manage.py startapp trivia

In the trivia app, create a templates directory and a trivia.html template file inside it. This template will be used to display the trivia game to the user.

Modify the views.py file in the trivia app to contain the following code:

``` 
import yaml
import random
import time
import select
from django.shortcuts import render
from openpyxl import Workbook

def trivia(request):
    # Load the questions from the YAML file
    with open('python_trivia.yaml') as file:
        questions = yaml.load(file, Loader=yaml.FullLoader)

    # Shuffle the questions randomly
    random.shuffle(questions)

    # Select the first 10 questions
    questions = questions[:10]

    # Create a new workbook and worksheet for the results
    workbook = Workbook()
    worksheet = workbook.active

    # Write the header row to the worksheet
    worksheet.append(['Question', 'User Answer', 'Correct Answer'])

    # Iterate over the shuffled questions
    for i, question in enumerate(questions):
        # Shuffle the options randomly
        random.shuffle(question['options'])

        # Prompt the user to enter their answer within 30 seconds
        start_time = time.time()
        user_answer = None
        while (time.time() - start_time) < 30:
            if select.select([request], [], [], 1)[0]:
                user_answer = request.POST.get('answer')
                break

        # Check if the user's answer is correct
        if user_answer is None:
            is_correct = 'No (timed out)'
        elif question['options'][int(user_answer)-1] == question['answer']:
            is_correct = 'Yes'
        else:
            is_correct = 'No'

        # Write the question number, user's answer, and correct answer to the worksheet
        worksheet.append([question['question'], question['options'][int(user_answer)-1] if user_answer is not None else '', question['answer']])

        # Add a column for whether the user's answer is correct
        worksheet.cell(row=i+2, column=4, value=is_correct)

    # Save the workbook to an XLSX file
    workbook.save('python_trivia_results.xlsx')

    return render(request, 'trivia.html')
```
## Modify the urls.py file in the project directory to include a URL pattern for the trivia game:

```
from django.urls import path
from trivia.views import trivia

urlpatterns = [
    path('trivia/', trivia, name='trivia'),
]
```

Modify the trivia.html template file to contain a form with radio buttons for each question:

```
<form method="post">
  {% csrf_token %}
  {% for question in questions %}
    <h3>{{ question.question }}</h3>
    {% for option in question.options %}
      <label><input type="radio" name="answer" value="{{ forloop.counter }}" required>{{ option }}</label><br>
    {% endfor %}
  {% endfor %}
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
```
Run the Django development server and visit http://localhost:8000/trivia/ to play the trivia game.
