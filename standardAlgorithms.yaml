- question: What is a sequential file?
  options:
    - Sequential file is a file that stores data in a sequential manner.
    - Sequential file is a file that stores data in a random manner.
    - Sequential file is a file that stores data in a hierarchical manner.
  answer: Sequential file is a file that stores data in a sequential manner.

- question: What is the difference between a sequential file and a relative file?
  options:
    - Sequential files store data in a sequential manner, while relative files store data in a random manner.
    - Sequential files are faster than relative files, while relative files are slower but more flexible.
    - Sequential files can only be read from beginning to end, while relative files can be read from any point.
  answer: Sequential files can only be read from beginning to end, while relative files can be read from any point.
